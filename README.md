# Data Science & AI Portfolio

This repository is the central hub for my applied work in **Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**.

I build projects that solve real-world problems with strong emphasis on:
- end-to-end ML pipelines
- analytical rigor
- interpretability
- measurable business impact
