# Data Science & AI Portfolio

This repository is the central portfolio for my applied work in **Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**.

I design and deliver projects that solve real business problems with a strong focus on:
- end-to-end ML execution
- analytical rigor
- interpretability
- measurable business value
