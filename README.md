# Data Science & AI Portfolio

This repository is the central hub for my applied work in **Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**.

Projects focus on solving real-world problems with an emphasis on:
- end-to-end ML pipelines,
- analytical rigor,
- interpretability,
- and measurable business impact.

## What you'll find here
- **End-to-end Machine Learning projects** (EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → deployment-ready structure)  
- **Analytics & KPI-driven dashboards** (business-oriented insights and decision support)  
- **NLP & LLM-based applications** (RAG, embeddings, semantic search)  
- **Case studies and technical deep-dives** (methodology, assumptions, trade-offs, and results)

## Featured Projects

### 1) [Basket AI — Market Basket Recommender](https://github.com/totkanligizem/basket_ai)
End-to-end recommendation pipeline: data prep → candidate generation → ranking → evaluation.  
**Highlights:** association rules + co-occurrence signals • offline metrics (Recall@K / NDCG@K) • reproducible notebooks & scripts  
**Stack:** Python • pandas • scikit-learn

## Current status
Projects are being added progressively.

Each project is published once it includes:
- a clear problem definition,
- reproducible code,
- documented assumptions,
- and interpretable results.
