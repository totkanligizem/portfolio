# Data Science & AI Portfolio

This repository serves as the central hub for my applied work in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

Projects here focus on solving real-world problems with an emphasis on:
- end-to-end ML pipelines,
- analytical rigor,
- interpretability,
- and measurable business impact.

## What you'll find here

- End-to-end Machine Learning projects  
  (EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → deployment-ready structure)

- Analytics & KPI-driven dashboards  
  (business-oriented insights and decision support)

- NLP & LLM-based applications  
  (RAG, embeddings, semantic search)

- Case studies and technical deep-dives  
  (methodology, assumptions, trade-offs, and results)

## Current status

🚧 Projects are being added progressively.

Each project is published once it includes:
- a clear problem definition,
- reproducible code,
- documented assumptions,
- and interpretable results.
